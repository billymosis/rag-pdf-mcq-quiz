Implement and, where necessary, update the estate plan.\n\n# I) Objectives and Goals \u2013 The First Step\n\nThe objectives and goals of an individual in the estate planning process are very dependent on one\u2019s personal value system. Generally, one would like to make all the necessary arrangements to provide maintenance and maximize the value of assets for the benefit of dependents as well as to minimize disputes, misunderstanding and inconveniences to family members. Of course, we also realize that, if all the proper arrangements are in place, unnecessary expenses and legal costs would also be kept to a minimum.\n\nWith this in mind, the following are some of the more common goals, most individuals would desire in the estate planning process:\n\n- Provide funds for funeral and testamentary expenses, and settlement of outstanding debts or loans.\n- Provide income to maintain a required standard of living to dependents and beneficiaries.\n- Establish adequate funds for children\u2019s education needs\n- Create trusts, where necessary, authorising the management of assets for the benefit of beneficiaries and dependants.\n- Making arrangements to deal with one\u2019s business interests such as those in partnerships and limited companies.\n- Provisions for charity or any other specific or peculiar wishes of the individual.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",

All relevant information or\n     the individual\u2019s assets, income, liabilities, outstanding debts and business interests must be\n     made available before advice can be given to a client.\n     Most planners would use a standard    \u201cfact finding\u201d questionnaire to obtain all that information.\n     The extent of ownership interest and any limitations or constrains that may exist in dealing with\n     any of the assets must also be identified. For example, if the client owns a piece of land, we\n     need to be aware if it is \u201ccharged\u201d to a financial institution as collateral for a loan or has any\n     other restrictions with regards to the disposal of the land.\nIII) Analyse and Evaluate \u2013 The Third Step\n     The purpose of this step is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the individual\u2019s position\n     in relation to his goals and aspirations. A client may have substantial assets which leads him\n     to believe that his estate planning goals may be achieved but he may have overlooked the\n     fact that he may also be highly geared or have significant liabilities which will reduce his net\n     worth at the time of death. These and similar issues need to be highlighted to the individual.\n     Furthermore \u201cownership rights\u201d may range from outright ownership to merely having a legal\n     interest as a trustee. The limits of an individual\u2019s beneficial rights and interest in assets will\n     have to be identified (see ownership rights below). This will determine how the assets may be\n     dealt with and the most suitable estate planning tools to be used.\nIV) Formulate Practical Strategies \u2013 The Fourth Step\n     This is the stage when the various strategies in dealing with the different types of assets are\n     formulated. Wills, trust, assignments, buy-sell agreements for business interest and powers of\n     attorney are some of the more common estate planning tools or legal instruments that are to be\n     advised.

Such delegated authority,\n         can be continued even after the death of the owner, if the POA is one that satisfies certain\n         legal requirements. (Details will be discussed in Chapter 5).\n    c)   Assignments of Insurance Polices\n         Assignments of insurance policies are also contractual arrangements, entered into by\n         policyowners with the objective of transferring the ownership or the benefits to others who\n         are called assignees.\n    d)   Joint Accounts \u2013 Bank and Unit Trusts\n         Joint account holders of bank accounts and unit trust investors who purchase them as\n         \u201cjoint owners\u201d may also have certain rights to deal with these type of assets upon the\n         death of one of the \u201cowners\u201d.

Such\n         arrangements allow the surviving business owners or appointed trustees to deal with the\n         interest of the deceased, subject to various terms and conditions which have been agreed\n         upon earlier (See Chapter 8 for further details).\nConclusion\nAs we have seen in this introductory chapter of estate planning, that it is a fascinating process\nthat encompasses a wide area of knowledge to be acquired by the financial planner. Although the\ndetails of the various legal principals and issues will not be within the scope of this course, the\nplanner must have a grasp of the overview of the processes so as to be of service to his clients\naccordingly. As was stated earlier, the estate planning process may be a delicate and sensitive\nsubject when discussing with clients, but which is nevertheless necessary for almost anyone who\nowns any form of assets.

Although the details of the various legal principals and issues will not be within the scope of this course, the planner must have a grasp of the overview of the processes so as to be of service to his clients accordingly. As was stated earlier, the estate planning process may be a delicate and sensitive subject when discussing with clients, but which is nevertheless necessary for almost anyone who owns any form of assets. Great care must be taken, when dealing with and advising clients and we must always take into consideration their personal and financial circumstances.\n\n1-10 Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",
