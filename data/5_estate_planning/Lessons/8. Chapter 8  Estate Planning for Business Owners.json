      "text": "RFP Programme - Module 5                                Chapter 8 : Estate Planning for Business Owners\npole Proprietors\nSole-proprietors may be those who are members of the various professional bodies or registered\nbusiness owners. Professionals such as lawyers, doctors and others are regulated by statutory law\nand they must comply with all the rules that are specified by their respective professional bodies.\nFor example, lawyers are regulated by the Legal Profession Act and one the several requirements\nis that they must renew their practising certificate annually.\nOther business owners who are not classified as professionals by law, must register with Registrar of\nBusinesses under the Companies Commission of Malaysia. They are regulated by the Registration\nof Business Act 1956 and the Registration of Business Rules 1957.\nThe assets and liabilities of a soleproprietor are that of the individual himself. There is no distinction\nin law as to whether assets are held in the name of the business or in the personal name of the\nsole-proprietor. Similarly, debts and liabilities of the business are also deemed personal to him,\nhence the common phrase “unlimited personal liability’. Upon his death, the assets and liabilities of\nthe business are that of his personal estate.

This may lead to a situation of a forced sale which would result in a lower\nvaluation of assets. All net proceeds are then apportioned to the various partners’ interest. The\ndeceased partner’s estate must be provided with an accounting of all the transactions. The heirs of\nthe deceased partner are legally entitled to get cash for the deceased’s interest in the business.\nSurviving partners cannot obtain loans on the credit or assets of the business. All business\ntransactions or contracts which were initiated before the death of the partner must be completed.\nNew contracts may only be entered into on the personal liability of the surviving partners. Profits\nmade in such transactions must be divided accordingly with the deceased partner’s estate but any\nloss must be borne by the surviving partners only. These then, are circumstances that will prevail\nshould the partnership business be wound-up. It is obvious that neither the surviving partners nor\nthe estate of the deceased partner will benefit form the winding-up process.\nWe have noted above, that most partnerships do not have a written agreement among the partners,\nand for those who have, they may not make any provision or arrangements should death occur to\na partner. The question to be asked is “Do most businesses wind-up upon the death of a partner?”\nThe answer to this is, “no”, because most businesses seem to carry on even upon the death of a\npartner. How is this so? Let us see what really happens in situations such as these.\nIn most cases, where a partner passes away, the surviving partner or partners, after a “negotiation\nprocess” offer compensation to the next-of-kin of the deceased. The family members of the\ndeceased partner are usually not in an advantageous or strong bargaining position to negotiate\nfavorable terms of compensation and therefore eventually accept whatever amount is offered to\nthem. Once the terms are agreed upon, the appropriate “paperwork” must be executed to effect\nthe transfer of ownership. For example, the wife of the deceased, must consent to transfer the\ndeceased’s interest to the surviving partners and complete the necessary documentation work\nwith the Companies Commission of Malaysia (or Registrar of Businesses). In professional firms or\npractices the respective professional bodies have to be notified and the appropriate arrangements\ncompleted to effect the change of ownership.\nOn the matter of fair compensation to the estate upon the death of a partner, many do not realise\nthat this is a serious matter which needs to be attended to from an estate planning perspective.\nThe most effective way to avoid this problem of disputes and to make arrangements for a smooth\nprocess of “business continuation” upon the death of a partner is to ensure that the partners enter\ninto an agreement to make the necessary and appropriate arrangements.

As expected, minority shareholders will usually have limited influence in the\n               management of the company. Major policy decisions are decided by the board of directors who\n      will delegate to a managing director, the authority to manage the company.\nPrivate iimited Companies C aeath of a phareholder\n        Many businesses operate as private limited companies with a relatively small number of individuals\n              who are shareholders as well as the directors of the company. It is very common to see these\n       companies with 2,3,4 or 5 shareholders who are also the directors. Upon the death of a shareholder,\n           the shares of the company held by him are deemed to be part of the assets of his estate and are\n  subject to the usual administrative procedures. There are also provisions in the Articles of Association\n         of the company that dictates the manner in which the shares are dealt with. The following are the\n3 main principles that apply:\ni)             The personal representative of the deceased shareholder shall be the only person recognised\n      by the company as having the right to deal with the shares. This         effectively means the Grant\n          of Probate or Letters of Administration has to be obtained by the legal representative before he\n      is permitted to deal with the deceased’s shares.\nii)         Beneficiaries of the shares of a deceased shareholder may request that the same be transferred\n               to themselves or may nominate others to receive their shares. In either case, the directors\n      have the right to decline or suspend the registration of shares to anyone accordingly.\niii)  The beneficiaries are also entitled to dividends, other advantages and the same        rights as the\n      deceased shareholder would have been entitled to if he had not died.\n           It is very common to find that the beneficiaries of the deceased shareholder are the spouse and\n                   immediate family. They may not have adequate knowledge of the business and may not want\n         to hold on or retain the shares. They would most likely prefer to dispose off their shares for an\n       attractive cash settlement. More so, holding on to the minority shares of a private limited company\nwould have very little financial benefits.\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)                                                   8-",

It is very common to see these companies with 2, 3, 4 or 5 shareholders who are also the directors. Upon the death of a shareholder, the shares of the company held by him are deemed to be part of the assets of his estate and are subject to the usual administrative procedures. There are also provisions in the Articles of Association of the company that dictates the manner in which the shares are dealt with. The following are the 3 main principles that apply:\n\n1. The personal representative of the deceased shareholder shall be the only person recognised by the company as having the right to deal with the shares. This effectively means the Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration has to be obtained by the legal representative before he is permitted to deal with the deceased’s shares.\n2. Beneficiaries of the shares of a deceased shareholder may request that the same be transferred to themselves or may nominate others to receive their shares. In either case, the directors have the right to decline or suspend the registration of shares to anyone accordingly.\n3. The beneficiaries are also entitled to dividends, other advantages and the same rights as the deceased shareholder would have been entitled to if he had not died.\n\nIt is very common to find that the beneficiaries of the deceased shareholder are the spouse and immediate family. They may not have adequate knowledge of the business and may not want to hold on or retain the shares. They would most likely prefer to dispose off their shares for an attractive cash settlement. More so, holding on to the minority shares of a private limited company would have very little financial benefits.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",

The\nPrice to Book Value method seeks to project the value using the price to book ratios of listed\ncompanies operating in the same sector as the company being valued, in comparison with the book\nvalue of the said company.\nThe disadvantage of this method is its high sensitivity to the relative age of assets. Certain assets\nmay have no intrinsic value and may lack the availability of suitable comparative data from listed\ncompanies.

It clearly implies\nthat premiums for only term and personal accident policies (i.e. policies without cash values), on the\nlife of employees, who are not shareholders of the company, are allowable as expenses. If these\npremiums are claimed as allowable expenses, then the claim proceeds are treated as a taxable.\nConclusion\nHigh net-worth individuals are usually business owners and professionals, people who would\ngreatly benefit from the service of an estate planner.
