Major policy decisions are decided by the board of directors who will delegate to a managing director, the authority to manage the company.",

The sum assured must reflect the financial loss that the company would face by the death\nof the key person. This involves a number of factors which may be difficult to quantify, such as the\nexpected profits of the company in the near future and the extent to which they depend on the key\nperson.\nThe general computation of the sum assured is by multiplying the company\u2019s gross profits with\nthe key person\u2019s remuneration and then dividing the total by the company\u2019s total remuneration of\nthe employees. (This estimates the contribution of the individual\u2019s efforts towards the company\u2019s\nprofits.) The figure derived thereof is then multiplied by the duration of the coverage under the said\npolicy.\nExample:           If the total gross profits were RM5 million, the key person\u2019s salary is RM250,000 and\n                   the total salaries paid by the company is RM2 million, the estimated apportionment of\n           annual profits attributed to him would be\n           RM5,000,000     x  RM   250,000     =     oj6O5,000\n                               ------------------\n                               RM2,000,000\nIf the compensation required is equivalent to 3 years of the key-person\u2019s contribution, then the sum\nassured of the insurance policy should be RM 625,000 x 3 = RM1,875,000\niiabilities of airectors\nThe estate planning arrangements for directors of companies must also take into consideration\nthe personal liabilities by virtue of their position in the companies. Although business liabilities\nfor directors who are shareholders may be limited to their investments in the company, they may\nhowever be personally liable for other related aspects of the business. Examples of these are seen\nwhen directors are guarantors of loans or income tax and employee provident fund (EPF) liabilities\nand compliance with statutory requirements of the Companies Commission of Malaysia. These\ncircumstances make the affected directors \u201cjointly and severally\u201d liable. As we also know by now,\nthis also means that if they pass away, their respective estates may then become liable.\nIf financial institutions offer loan or credit facilities to companies, they usually request the main or\nactive directors to be guarantors to these loans. It is therefore advisable to insure the directors,\nor at least the key person among them for an appropriate sum. Such insurance should be on this\nkey-person\u2019s life for an amount equal to the loan facility given to the company. Popularly known as\n\u201cdebt cancellation insurance\u201d, the term is self explanatory i.e. upon the director\u2019s death, insurance\npolicy moneys are available to pay off, or settle outstanding loans to the lender.\n8-16                                                         Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",

This involves a number of factors which may be difficult to quantify, such as the expected profits of the company in the near future and the extent to which they depend on the key person.\n\nThe general computation of the sum assured is by multiplying the company\u2019s gross profits with the key person\u2019s remuneration and then dividing the total by the company\u2019s total remuneration of the employees. (This estimates the contribution of the individual\u2019s efforts towards the company\u2019s profits.) The figure derived thereof is then multiplied by the duration of the coverage under the said policy.\n\nExample: If the total gross profits were RM5 million, the key person\u2019s salary is RM250,000 and the total salaries paid by the company is RM2 million, the estimated apportionment of annual profits attributed to him would be\n\n| RM5,000,000        | x | RM 250,000  | = | oj6O5,000 |\n| ------------------ | - | ----------- | - | --------- |\n| ------------------ |   | RM2,000,000 |   |           |\n\nIf the compensation required is equivalent to 3 years of the key-person\u2019s contribution, then the sum assured of the insurance policy should be RM 625,000 x 3 = RM1,875,000\n\n# iiabilities of airectors\n\nThe estate planning arrangements for directors of companies must also take into consideration the personal liabilities by virtue of their position in the companies. Although business liabilities for directors who are shareholders may be limited to their investments in the company, they may however be personally liable for other related aspects of the business. Examples of these are seen when directors are guarantors of loans or income tax and employee provident fund (EPF) liabilities and compliance with statutory requirements of the Companies Commission of Malaysia. These circumstances make the affected directors \u201cjointly and severally\u201d liable. As we also know by now, this also means that if they pass away, their respective estates may then become liable.\n\nIf financial institutions offer loan or credit facilities to companies, they usually request the main or active directors to be guarantors to these loans. It is therefore advisable to insure the directors, or at least the key person among them for an appropriate sum. Such insurance should be on this key-person\u2019s life for an amount equal to the loan facility given to the company. Popularly known as \u201cdebt cancellation insurance\u201d, the term is self explanatory i.e. upon the director\u2019s death, insurance policy moneys are available to pay off, or settle outstanding loans to the lender.\n\n8-16 Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",

It must be noted that a company may not be the policy owner and even if it is, in such types of arrangements, it cannot claim these premiums as a \u201cdeductible business expense\u201d. On the other hand, the proceeds of these policies upon the death of an individual are tax free in the hands of the recipients.\n\nIn key-person insurance policies, the uncertainty of the tax treatment was resolved by the Inland Revenue Board\u2019s Public Ruling No 2/2003 which was issued on 30\u1d57\u02b0 Dec 2003. It clearly implies that premiums for only term and personal accident policies (i.e. policies without cash values), on the life of employees, who are not shareholders of the company, are allowable as expenses. If these premiums are claimed as allowable expenses, then the claim proceeds are treated as taxable.",
