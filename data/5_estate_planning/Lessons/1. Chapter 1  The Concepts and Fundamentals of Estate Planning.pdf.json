All relevant information or\n     the individual’s assets, income, liabilities, outstanding debts and business interests must be\n     made available before advice can be given to a client.\n     Most planners would use a standard    “fact finding” questionnaire to obtain all that information.\n     The extent of ownership interest and any limitations or constrains that may exist in dealing with\n     any of the assets must also be identified. For example, if the client owns a piece of land, we\n     need to be aware if it is “charged” to a financial institution as collateral for a loan or has any\n     other restrictions with regards to the disposal of the land.\nIII) Analyse and Evaluate – The Third Step\n     The purpose of this step is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the individual’s position\n     in relation to his goals and aspirations. A client may have substantial assets which leads him\n     to believe that his estate planning goals may be achieved but he may have overlooked the\n     fact that he may also be highly geared or have significant liabilities which will reduce his net\n     worth at the time of death. These and similar issues need to be highlighted to the individual.\n     Furthermore “ownership rights” may range from outright ownership to merely having a legal\n     interest as a trustee. The limits of an individual’s beneficial rights and interest in assets will\n     have to be identified (see ownership rights below). This will determine how the assets may be\n     dealt with and the most suitable estate planning tools to be used.\nIV) Formulate Practical Strategies – The Fourth Step\n     This is the stage when the various strategies in dealing with the different types of assets are\n     formulated. Wills, trust, assignments, buy-sell agreements for business interest and powers of\n     attorney are some of the more common estate planning tools or legal instruments that are to be\n     advised. This is done, taking into consideration the need to make provisions to settle liabilities\n     and debts and preserve the various assets in accordance with the specific needs of the client.\n     As a further example, nominations of insurance policies or EPF funds must be looked into and\n     the effects of this must be considered in giving such moneys to the intended beneficiaries.\nV)   Developing an Estate Plan – The Fifth Step\n     Having completed all the above steps, the financial planner is now equipped to present an\n     estate plan or “estate planning brief” to the client.\n     The brief should include the following:\n     i)   the clients goals and objectives\n     ii)  the financial details as to the assets, income and liabilities\n1-4                                                        Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",
