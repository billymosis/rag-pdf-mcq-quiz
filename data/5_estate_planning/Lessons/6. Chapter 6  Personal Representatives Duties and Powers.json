For example, if a son is the sole or surviving executor dies prior to completing the administration of the estate of his father then the executor of the estate of the son’s would administer his estate and continue the administration of the estate of the father as well. This chain of representation will continue until it is broken by a failure to appoint an executor.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC) 6-P",
          "md": "of one person acting as a PR but not more than four. However, the Act also states that if beneficiaries are minors (i.e. below 18 years of age), there must be a minimum of two PRs. This requirement of two persons is not applicable if the PR is a Trust Corporation which can act on its own, even if the beneficiaries of the estate are minors.\n\nIn a testacy, the executor is appointed by the testator and there are usually no significant problems that may arise in confirming his role as one. However, in the case of an intestacy, then it is for the courts to decide as to who is the person that is most suitable to administer estate. The administrator must be someone who has an interest in the estate, such as a family member or dependent or even creditors of the estate. Of course, it is also a requirement that the PR must not be a minor, must be of sound mind and not be a bankrupt.\n\n1. The executor or executrix (female executor) is the person appointed by the testator to carry out the instructions in the Will. He derives his powers from the Will but nevertheless must obtain the Grant of Probate from the court before he is authorised to carry out his duties and responsibilities. In appointing an executor, the testator must be confident that he is competent and willing to carry out the duties expected of him. The responsibility can be very ‘heavy’ and there have been cases where executors were unwilling to carry out their duties. In these circumstances, the appointed executor must renounce his role as executor so that any other person may make an application to the court to be the PR.\n2. The administrator or administratrix (female administrator) is the person appointed by the court to administer the estate. He must be someone who has an interest in the estate and once confirmed, his duties and responsibilities are similar to that of an executor. An administrator can only exercise his powers upon obtaining the letters of administration which also gives him the powers to act accordingly.\n3. An executor de son tort (latin phrase for an executor in his own wrong) is someone who intermeddles with the affairs of the estate. He acts as the PR although he is neither an executor or administrator. Although he has none of the privileges of a PR he nevertheless is personally liable for any wrong or loss to the estate, as a result of his actions.\n4. An administrator de bonis non is one who is appointed when the sole or surviving administrator dies without completing the administration of the estate. He is to carry out the duties as an administrator for the “goods left unadministered”. This, he can only do after he receives the letters of administration de bonis non from the court.\n\nThe P & A Act provides that an executor or a sole or last surviving executor of a testator shall be the executor of that testator. So long as the chain of representation is unbroken, the last executor in the chain of representation is the executor of every preceding executor. For example, if a son is the sole or surviving executor dies prior to completing the administration of the estate of his father then the executor of the estate of the son’s would administer his estate and continue the administration of the estate of the father as well. This chain of representation will continue until it is broken by a failure to appoint an executor.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC) 6-P",

This is because\nhe is expected to carry out these functions in an efficient manner with the responsibility of a\nfiduciary role with regards to the beneficiary of the estate. Clients must therefore seriously consider\nappointing the right PRs to fulfill their wishes long after they have passed away. Careful planning\nand detailed instructions will be most useful depending on the type of assets in the client’s estate.\nThe laws are there to protect beneficiaries but PRs have nevertheless a great discretion in the\nexecution of their duties. Thus if individuals are appointed as PRs, the character and integrity of\nsuch individuals should be a foremost requirement to be considered.\n6-10                                                     Malaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",
