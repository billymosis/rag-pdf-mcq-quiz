This is most commonly done by a trust deed or\n     by means of a will. The trustee is bound by the terms and conditions of the Deed or Will.\n3.        The trustee \u201cholds\u201d and manages the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. He thus has\n        a fiduciary duty towards them, and who are deemed to have the equitable or beneficial title of\n     the assets.\n     The above general principles of a trust were \u201cborn\u201d several hundred years ago in England and\n           became part of the law there. Malaysia has of course, inherited these concepts but over the\n              years, as was expected, the legal principles governing trusts have evolved and have been\n     modified by statutory and case law (or judicial precedents).\nPurposes of a Trust\nOne of the main purposes of creating a trust is to authorise the trustee to manage the assets for\nthe benefit of beneficiary. This may arise because of the following circumstances or a combination\nof these:\ni)   the trustee has special skills on knowledge\n     eg. for investment purposes\nii)  the settlor will be away from the country for a considerable length of time\niii) the settlor may make provisions to appoint the trustee to manage the asset upon his death.\nSecondly where a trustee is needed as a custodian to protect the interest of beneficiaries.\neg. as seen in the unit trusts industry in Malaysia\nThirdly, trust arrangements may also protect the beneficiaries from creditors of the settlor. Such\nprotection is seen in statute law, more specifically in Paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 of the Financial\nServices Act 2013 or also by creation of irrevocable trusts (to be discussed later).\nFourthly, in certain countries (may not be relevant in Malaysia) trust arrangements can also provide\ntax advantages on investments.\nPurposes of Trusts in Estate Planning\nWhilst a Will may be the most appropriate instrument in passing on gifts to beneficiaries upon the\ndeath of a Testator, in some circumstances the creation of a trust may be more advisable. This is\nbecause, a trustee can be appointed to manage the assets for the beneficiaries for the time being,\nand if instructed to do so, may transfer such assets to them at a later time.

There is no mention in the Will, that the asset specified is the subject matter of a\ntrust. Thus the trust, in this case is a secret and takes effect on the death of the testator.\nA Half Secret Trust occurs where the asset is left by Will to a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d and it states that he is\nto hold it in trust. The terms or the beneficiaries of the trust are not stated in the Will but are agreed\nbetween testator and the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d.\nOff-Shore Trusts can be created outside the country of the individual, more specifically in off-shore\nfinancial centers that are regarded tax free havens eg.

It is indeed\nthe responsibility of the financial planner to identify and advise his clients as to the importance and\nthe advantages of creating trusts for the appropriate assets of a client.
