His equitable interest will be proportionate\n        to the purchase price of the property. For example, if a person contributes RM 250,000 towards the\n           purchase of a house that costs RM 1 million, it is deemed that he has acquired 25% of its value\nbased on the resulting trust principle.

Such a person is said to hold the money in constructive trust for the person who is rightly entitled to it. In practice, constructive trusts can arise in various ways, whereby the courts will always analyse the facts and the circumstances before treating them as such.\n\nA statutory trust is created by means of Paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 of the Financial Services Act 2013. The object of this trust is to allow for nominees of a life insurance or personal accident policy to benefit from the policy moneys which are payable upon the death of the policyowner in such a manner that these moneys are not subject to the creditors of the estate. This is specified in subparagraph (1) and (2) of Paragraph 5 of Schedule 10.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC) 4-5",
          "md": "between the settlor and the trustee. In comparison to this, a testamentary trust is created by means of a Will in which case it becomes effective upon the death of the testator.\n\nii) A revocable (living) trust is one where the Settlor reserves the rights to change or end the trust at any time. Such a trust is termed as an incomplete gift and has certain consequences for tax and bankruptcy purposes. An irrevocable (living) trust is created when the assets are permanently placed in trust and the Settlor cannot reclaim them. One of the advantages of this type of trust is that the assets may be exempted from claims under bankruptcy proceedings (details to be seen later). It must be noted that a testamentary trust, created under a will is always revocable until the death of the testator, when it of course, becomes irrevocable.\n\niii) When there is a class of beneficiaries eg. all the children of the settlor, a fixed trust stipulates a specific proportion is to be distributed to them and the trustee has no element of discretion to vary the shares. A bare trust is the most minimal form of fixed trust whereby the trustee holds the rights and follows the instructions of the beneficiaries. A discretionary trust on the other hand allows the trustee to distribute to members within the class of beneficiaries and in whatever proportion he thinks is appropriate.\n\nExpress trusts are those which are created whereby the intentions of the Settlor are as to the assets and beneficiaries are clearly spelt out. These are of course usually done by a trust deed or by means of a Will. These are the most common types of trusts used for estate planning purposes. In contrast to express trusts, there are implied trusts such as resulting trusts and constructive trusts.\n\nResulting trusts are those implied by the law (or the courts), whereby they are not intentionally created by the Settlor. One situation, where such a trust is said to arise is when a testamentary trust fails because a lone beneficiary has predeceased the testator (settlor). It is said that the assets which is the subject matter of the trust will “result back” to the Settlor (or his estate). A second situation where a resultant trust will arise is where a person contributes to a purchase price of a property, he is deemed to have an equitable (or beneficial) interest in that property although his name will not be identified as the registered owner. His equitable interest will be proportionate to the purchase price of the property. For example, if a person contributes RM 250,000 towards the purchase of a house that costs RM 1 million, it is deemed that he has acquired 25% of its value based on the resulting trust principle.\n\nA constructive trust also arises by operation of law. If for example, a person has received money which to his knowledge was paid to him mistakenly, the law will deem him to be a constructive trustee. Such a person is said to hold the money in constructive trust for the person who is rightly entitled to it. In practice, constructive trusts can arise in various ways, whereby the courts will always analyse the facts and the circumstances before treating them as such.\n\nA statutory trust is created by means of Paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 of the Financial Services Act 2013. The object of this trust is to allow for nominees of a life insurance or personal accident policy to benefit from the policy moneys which are payable upon the death of the policyowner in such a manner that these moneys are not subject to the creditors of the estate.
