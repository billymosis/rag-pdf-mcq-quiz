For example,\n                when a person residing outside Malaysia is entitled to a Grant of Probate or Letters\n                 of Administration, these Certificates may be granted to his attorney (or donee) for\n                   his use and benefit. This procedure shall be subject to any specific requirements\n                           as the Registrar of the High Court may direct. Another example maybe seen\n                       when a deceased person residing in Malaysia has left behind assets in another\n                      Commonwealth Country, for example, Singapore. Once the grant of representation\n                    (i.e. the Probate or LA) is obtain issued by the Malaysian High Court, the legal\n                    representative should appoint an attorney (using a POA) to \u201creseal\u201d the grant of\n                    representative in the Singapore High Court to enable him to deal with the assets\n               accordingly. For those purpose a POAis a very useful instrument in the administration\n               estate of the estate of the deceased, outside the country.\naocuments and procedures of POAs\n    Thus far, we have become familiar with the main principles on the subject matter of POAs. In the\n    execution of a POA there are several legal rules, practices and procedures that must be complied\n  with, for it to be valid in law. Although these are not essential for the knowledge of a financial\n planner, it is very useful to have such awareness so that clients may be advised accordingly. These\n        procedures are of course well known to most lawyers, the people whose services we would need\nto engage, should a POA be necessary.\n  Most of the rules governing a POA is found in the Act itself.

They are:\n\n1. Partnerships \u2013 power to manage partnership business.\n2. Transactions of immovable assets \u2013 for example, to authorise the donee to execute the necessary transfer documents for the purposes of a sale.\n3. Probate and administration \u2013 whereby a donor who is an executor or administrator may grant a POA to a donee to deal with assets outside the country. For example, when a person residing outside Malaysia is entitled to a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration, these Certificates may be granted to his attorney (or donee) for his use and benefit. This procedure shall be subject to any specific requirements as the Registrar of the High Court may direct. Another example may be seen when a deceased person residing in Malaysia has left behind assets in another Commonwealth Country, for example, Singapore. Once the grant of representation (i.e. the Probate or LA) is obtained and issued by the Malaysian High Court, the legal representative should appoint an attorney (using a POA) to \u201creseal\u201d the grant of representation in the Singapore High Court to enable him to deal with the assets accordingly. For those purposes, a POA is a very useful instrument in the administration of the estate of the deceased, outside the country.\n\n# Documents and Procedures of POAs\n\nThus far, we have become familiar with the main principles on the subject matter of POAs. In the execution of a POA, there are several legal rules, practices, and procedures that must be complied with, for it to be valid in law.
