The term \u2018insolvency\u2019 refers\nto the situation whereby a person\u201fs liabilities exceed his assets, thus making him unable to pay off\nhis debts. The two terms are different, as an insolvent person only becomes a bankrupt after the\ncourt has declared him to be so i.e. by making a court order to that effect. Therefore a bankrupt is\ninsolvent but an insolvent person is not necessarily a bankrupt. The debtor can only be called a\nbankrupt after the court has made the order (known in legal terms as the adjudication order).\nThe objective of making a debtor bankrupt are:\n(a)  to secure a fair distribution of the debtor\u201fs assets among his creditors;\n(b)  to relieve the debtor from his debts and to enable him to make a fresh start as soon as he is\n     discharged by the court;\nThe law of bankruptcy is stated in the Bankruptcy Act 1967 (hereinafter referred to as \u201ethe Act in the\nsection\u201f) and the law on procedure is found in the Bankruptcy Rules 1967.\nEffects of Adjudication Order\nOnce an adjudication order is made, the bankrupt\u201fs assets vests in the Director General of\nInsolvency (or DGI) (previously the Official Assignee) who will decide on how to distribute the\nassets among the creditors. The DGI will take charge of the assets; he steps into the bankrupt\u201fs\nshoes and has full control over the bankrupt\u201fs assets. The DGI will also decide on whether certain\nearlier transactions entered into by the bankrupt are still valid or not. By this we mean transactions\nentered into by the bankrupt prior to him being declared a bankrupt. The relevant section on this\nis Section 52(1) of the Act. There are two circumstances provided for under this section and they\nare as follows:\n1)   Any settlement of property done \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026if                the settlor becomes bankrupt within two years\n     after the date of the settlement will be absolutely void against the DGI\u2026..\n2)   .......and shall if, the settlor becomes bankrupt\u2026\u2026\u2026 within five years\u2026\u2026. of the settlement,\n     be void against the DGI unless the parties claiming under the settlement can prove that the\n     settlor was at the time of making the settlement, able to pay all his debts without the aid of that\n     property\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nThe meaning of the term \u201esettlement\u201f is stated in section 52(3) as follows:\n     ...... \u201esettlement\u201f includes any conveyance or transfer of property, bill, bond, note, security for\n     money or covenant for the payment of money and any gift of money.\nAs can be seen, the term \u201esettlement\u201f is widely drafted and thus can include an insurance policy\nwhich has been absolutely assigned and also a trust policy.\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)                                                    7-7",

The two terms are different, as an insolvent person only becomes a bankrupt after the court has declared him to be so i.e. by making a court order to that effect. Therefore a bankrupt is insolvent but an insolvent person is not necessarily a bankrupt. The debtor can only be called a bankrupt after the court has made the order (known in legal terms as the adjudication order).\n\nThe objective of making a debtor bankrupt are:\n\n1. to secure a fair distribution of the debtor\u201fs assets among his creditors;\n2. to relieve the debtor from his debts and to enable him to make a fresh start as soon as he is discharged by the court;\n\nThe law of bankruptcy is stated in the Bankruptcy Act 1967 (hereinafter referred to as \u201ethe Act in the section\u201f) and the law on procedure is found in the Bankruptcy Rules 1967.\n\n# Effects of Adjudication Order\n\nOnce an adjudication order is made, the bankrupt\u201fs assets vests in the Director General of Insolvency (or DGI) (previously the Official Assignee) who will decide on how to distribute the assets among the creditors. The DGI will take charge of the assets; he steps into the bankrupt\u201fs shoes and has full control over the bankrupt\u201fs assets. The DGI will also decide on whether certain earlier transactions entered into by the bankrupt are still valid or not. By this we mean transactions entered into by the bankrupt prior to him being declared a bankrupt. The relevant section on this is Section 52(1) of the Act. There are two circumstances provided for under this section and they are as follows:\n\n1. Any settlement of property done \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026if the settlor becomes bankrupt within two years after the date of the settlement will be absolutely void against the DGI\u2026\u2026.\n2. .......and shall if, the settlor becomes bankrupt\u2026\u2026\u2026 within five years\u2026\u2026. of the settlement, be void against the DGI unless the parties claiming under the settlement can prove that the settlor was at the time of making the settlement, able to pay all his debts without the aid of that property\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nThe meaning of the term \u201esettlement\u201f is stated in section 52(3) as follows:\n\n...... \u201esettlement\u201f includes any conveyance or transfer of property, bill, bond, note, security for money or covenant for the payment of money and any gift of money.\n\nAs can be seen, the term \u201esettlement\u201f is widely drafted and thus can include an insurance policy which has been absolutely assigned and also a trust policy.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",
