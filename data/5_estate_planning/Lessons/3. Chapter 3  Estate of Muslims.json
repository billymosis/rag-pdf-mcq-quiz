We however are aware by now that the Probate and Administration Act 1959 applies to Muslims as well. Thus, to administer the estate of a Muslim, the Grant of Probate or Letter of Administration is still required. We thus come to realise that the most effective way to administer the estate is to advise a Muslim to write a Will, one that does comply with the requirements of the Wills Act 1959 as closely as possible so that there is no difficulty in obtaining the Grant of Probate from the courts.\n\nA Muslim Will is also called a Wasiyah and traditionally, the main purpose was to leave a gift or bequest up to one-third of the testator’s estate and may only be given to non-legal heirs. Such bequests can be made to adopted children, non-muslim parents or also for charitable or religious purposes.\n\nIf a Muslim person wishes not to dispose off up to one-third of his estate, which also means that his intention is for all his assets to be distributed according to the hukum Faraid, we should still advise him to write a Will. Why is this so? The importance of this is that he must be advised to appoint an executor in the Will. The naming of the executor in the Will would definitely make the obtaining.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)",
          "md": "We have seen earlier that Muslims may give away one-third or less of the estate to “outsiders” or non legal heirs. What do they have to do to give away this portion of their estate? A Muslim person must have made some form of declaration for the purpose of disposing off his estate to “outsiders”. This may be done orally or in writing. If the declaration is in writing, it need not be signed, and if signed it need not be attested by witnesses. What is essential is that the intention of the individual must be clear and unambiguous. Thus, even a mute can make such a declaration through gestures! These are the accepted principles in Islamic law as applicable to the distribution of the assets of Muslims upon death.\n\nWe can see from these principles, and we have learnt earlier that the Wills Act 1959 and the formalities required for a Will therein, do not apply to Muslims.
