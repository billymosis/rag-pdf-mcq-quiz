In the state of Negeri Sembilan, for example,\n                 immoveable assets are subject to the Adat Pepatih rules and female members of the clan\n     inherit the ancestral assets and hold it in trust for the tribe.\nWills for Muslims\nWe have seen earlier that Muslims may give away one-third or less of the estate to      \u201coutsiders\u201d\nor non legal heirs. What do they have to do to give away this portion of their estate? A Muslim\nperson must have made some form of declaration for the purpose of disposing off his estate to\n\u201coutsiders\u201d. This may be done orally or in writing. If the declaration is in writing, it need not be\nsigned, and if signed it need not be attested by witnesses. What is essential is that the intention of\nthe individual must be clear and unambiguous. Thus, even a mute can make such on declaration\nthrough gestures! These are the accepted principles in Islamic law as applicable to the distribution\nof the assets of Muslims upon death.\nWe can see from these principles, and we have learnt earlier that the Wills Act 1959 and the\nformalities required for a Will therein, do not apply to Muslims. We however are aware by now that\nthe Probate and Administration Act 1959 applies to Muslims as well. Thus, to administer the estate\nof a Muslim, the Grant of Probate or Letter of Administration is still required. We thus come to\nrealise that the most effective way to administer the estate is to advise a Muslim to write a Will, one\nthat does comply with the requirements of the Wills Act 1959 as closely as possible so that there is\nno difficulty is obtaining the Grant of Probate from the courts.\nA Muslim Will is also called a Wasiyah and traditionally, the main purpose was to leave a gift or\nbequest up to one-third, of the testator\u201fs estate and may only be given to non- legal heirs. Such\nbequests can be made to adopted children, non-muslim parents or also for charitable or religious\npurposes.\nIf a Muslim person wishes not to dispose off up to one-third of his estate, which also means that his\nintention is for all his assets to be distributed according to the hukum Faraid, we should still advise\nhim to write a Will. Why is this so? The importance of this is that he must be advised to appoint\nan executor in the Will. The naming of the executor in the Will would definitely make the obtaining\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)                                                         3-3",

We thus come to realise that the most effective way to administer the estate is to advise a Muslim to write a Will, one that does comply with the requirements of the Wills Act 1959 as closely as possible so that there is no difficulty in obtaining the Grant of Probate from the courts.\n\nA Muslim Will is also called a Wasiyah and traditionally, the main purpose was to leave a gift or bequest up to one-third of the testator\u2019s estate and may only be given to non-legal heirs.

Assets of such a trust arrangement will no longer be deemed part of the estate of a Muslim upon his subsequent death. If a Muslim chooses to create such a trust the beneficiaries may be anyone or organisation of his choice. Being an outright gift made during his lifetime, the portions given to the beneficiaries, which is declared in the trust deed, need not be in accordance with the hukum Faraid.\n\nA Muslim client may however, create a trust for purposes of professional management of his assets and choose to distribute the various portions according to the hukum Faraid. This of course, is acceptable as it does not contravene Islamic law principles.\n\nWe must also at this point, be reminded of the statutory trusts created by Paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 (Section 130) of Financial Services Act 2013. This trust is applicable only to non-Muslims and thereby Muslims cannot benefit from the \u201ccreditor protection\u201d benefit that it offers.",
