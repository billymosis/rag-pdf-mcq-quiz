We shall now see some of these.\n\n1. Writing\nThe Will must be in writing (unless it is a privileged Will – see notes later). It can be handwritten, typewritten or printed.\n2. Language\nThe wordings of the Will need not be in legal or formal language so long as it is capable of comprehension.\n3. Testator’s Signature\nThe Testator must sign or affix his mark (for example thumbprint or signature) at the end of the Will.\n4. Witnesses Signature\nThe Testator must sign or acknowledge his signature in the presence of at least two witnesses and the two witnesses must sign in the presence of the Testator and each other. It is important to note that the witnesses cannot be beneficiaries or spouse(s) of the beneficiary(ies) to the Will. If such a circumstance arises, it does not necessarily invalidate the Will. That which is invalidated, is the gift to that witness, i.e. the witness would not receive his gift under the Will.\n5. Testator’s/Testatrix’s Age\nIn West Malaysia and Sarawak, a person must be at least 18 years of age before he can be a Testator and in Sabah the person must be at least 21 years.\n6. Testamentary capacity\n1. Sound Mind\nA person must be of sound mind and understanding when making the Will. He must know that he is making a Will and understand the nature of the Will and the transaction therein and not be under any “influence” (e.g. drugs or intoxication). If a Testator is very ill at the time of execution of the Will, it is advisable to have a doctor as one of the witnesses and if possible request the doctor attending to the Testator to make a record of the Testator’s mental state at that time and the record to be kept together with the Will. It is important for the Testator to give a reason in his Will if he is excluding the spouse or a particular child entirely from his estate so as to avoid the Will being contested on the grounds that the Testator was not of sound mind when executing the Will.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC)\n\n2-3",
