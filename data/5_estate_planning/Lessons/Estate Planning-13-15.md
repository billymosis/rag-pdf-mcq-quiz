Picture this: Members of a large family comprising nine children continue to be embroiled in legal tussles, aggressively asserting inheritance rights in bids to carve out a piece of the sizeable fortune left behind by their father, who died intestate over six years ago.

Here is another scenario. With the intelligent use of a trust and a will that pours everything into the trust, another family and several beneficiaries outside the family now enjoy in quiet comfort the assets bequeathed to them by a widow, knowing that their inheritance would not be exposed to the public eye.

Don’t these situations sound familiar? You might expect them to come right out of television dramas, but they are actually unfolding in the real world. Mere words cannot begin to describe the stark difference between the absence of estate planning and thoughtful estate planning.

# When no Estate Planning is Done

The first family is that of the Taiwanese tycoon Wang Yung Ching. Touted as the “god of management”, Wang built his businesses and assets to the tune of billions of dollars, and left them all behind for his nine children (none begotten from his widow) to fight over. Pablo Picasso, Sonny Bono, Howard Hughes, and yes, Wang Yung Ching, were but only a few famous people who did just that. Every one of these instances led to prolonged court wrangling, intrigue and complications.

Indeed, the woes of the beneficiaries do pile up nonstop. In Malaysia, delays in the estate distribution of one who died intestate could arise from the beneficiaries’ disagreement over whom to appoint as the executor. As Malaysians accumulate unprecedented levels of wealth and grapple with its orderly and timely distribution, estate planning is fast becoming a necessity.

Traditional Asian emphasis on family ties is being tested, if not strained or broken, by spreading affluence and more aggressive assertions of inheritance rights. Estate planning is not just for the wealthy. It is for anyone who has any level of wealth and wishes to bequeath convenience, comfort and privacy to their loved ones instead of putting them through an agonising ordeal which might become very nasty and very public.

On a separate note, Muslims are subject to Islamic Laws, in which up to one third of one’s estate can be distributed via one’s will, and the remainder via a Sijil Faraid (a certificate issued by the Shariah court regarding the distribution of a Muslim estate Inheritance).

# Pitfalls to avoid

If one organised one’s estate planning to the level that Joan Rivers did hers, much of the agony of inheritance distribution we see around us could have been avoided. Having said that, however, I understand things might still go wrong in one’s estate planning efforts. The deceptive downside of inadequate planning quality is the false sense of security that everything that should be taken care of has been effectively taken care of.

It would be a shame to painstakingly ascertain one’s assets, decide who the beneficiaries should be and think through how the assets are to be split among the beneficiaries, only for disputes to arise despite the testator’s best intentions, or for assets to end up distributed against the spirit of the testator’s wishes. Unfortunately, it happens in real life. Some key stumbling blocks could negate the effectiveness of estate planning efforts. Let’s see where things can go wrong, so you know what to look out for in your estate planning endeavours.

# 1. Failing to tell your loved ones where your original documents are

A will that cannot be found is as good as no will. This happened to Olympic sprinter Florence “Flo Jo” Griffith Joyner, which led to disputes between her husband and mother. In Malaysia, the court requires the executor to produce the original copy of the will before they will issue a Grant of Probate.

# 2. Failing to update estate documents to include new beneficiaries or new assets

Estate documents include wills, trust deeds, insurance policies and retirement accounts. This is a common oversight among those who managed to get some estate planning done. Taking estate planning as a one-time exercise could lead to unintended consequences as the circumstances upon one’s demise could be very different from those when the estate planning exercise was conducted. Actor Heath Ledger had a will when he died at the age of 28, but he had written it three years before, and had left his entire estate to his sister and parents. In the ensuing three years, he had a daughter, whom he did not get down to revising his will to include.

# 3. Failing to take into account events that revoke a will

Certain events – such as making a later will, marriage and conversion to Islam – would render a will made prior to them invalid, even if the will was otherwise valid. It would therefore be advisable to take note of such events. In addition, intentional destruction of a will by the testator or a duly executed declaration of revocation by the testator will revoke the will. Unlike a marriage, divorce does not revoke a will.

# 4. Failing to consider the implications of “tenancy in common” and “joint tenancy” when purchasing a property

Both types of joint ownership – “tenancy in common” and “joint tenancy” – have their pros and cons. A tenant-in-common owner is able to will away to others his/her interest in the property without the consent of the other owners. Should a tenant-in-common die intestate, intestacy laws will apply to his/her share of the property. In Malaysia, jointly held properties tend to be in the “tenancy in common” form. In contrast, a joint-tenancy owner is unable to will away to others his/her interest in the property. Hence, upon his/her demise, the surviving joint tenant or tenants would automatically get his/her interest in the property. Malaysians have to be aware of this type of joint ownership, especially if they jointly hold properties in other countries, where joint tenancy is as widespread as tenancy in common. If a testator subsequently wills away his/her share of a joint tenancy property, it is likely to be disregarded for being void.

# 5. Failing to include back-up nominees

To be prudent, “what if” possibilities ought to be carefully considered and addressed in your estate planning endeavours. Back-up nominees for executors and trustees should be written into the estate documents in the event one’s original choices pre-decease one or cease to be up to the job in the testator’s opinion.

Incorporating back-up nominees helps to reduce hassle and delays when the estate documents are called upon for execution.

# 6. Failing to fulfil family obligations

Disputes might arise from challenges to the testator’s choice of beneficiaries. This is likely to happen if a testator bequeaths her entire estate to, say her hairdresser, rather than to her immediate family members. In the spirit of fulfilling family obligations, Malaysia’s Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1971 contains provisions that protect the interests of certain classes of immediate family dependents in the event they have not been provided for, or reasonably provided for.

Not a one-time exercise

It is to Joan River’s credit that she revisited her estate documents several times during her life. According to her will, the trust was the eleventh amendment of the original document. Her commitment to estate planning is central to the ease and comfort enjoyed by those who stand to gain from her estate. As you have worked hard to accumulate your assets, it would be a life well-lived if you would show your loved ones how much you care for them by making legacy plans according to your situation now.
