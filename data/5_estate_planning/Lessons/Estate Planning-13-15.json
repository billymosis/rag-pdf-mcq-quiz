Let’s see where things can go wrong, so you know what to look out for in your estate planning endeavours.\n\n# 1. Failing to tell your loved ones where your original documents are\n\nA will that cannot be found is as good as no will. This happened to Olympic sprinter Florence “Flo Jo” Griffith Joyner, which led to disputes between her husband and mother. In Malaysia, the court requires the executor to produce the original copy of the will before they will issue a Grant of Probate.\n\n# 2. Failing to update estate documents to include new beneficiaries or new assets\n\nEstate documents include wills, trust deeds, insurance policies and retirement accounts. This is a common oversight among those who managed to get some estate planning done. Taking estate planning as a one-time exercise could lead to unintended consequences as the circumstances upon one’s demise could be very different from those when the estate planning exercise was conducted. Actor Heath Ledger had a will when he died at the age of 28, but he had written it three years before, and had left his entire estate to his sister and parents. In the ensuing three years, he had a daughter, whom he did not get down to revising his will to include.\n\n# 3. Failing to take into account events that revoke a will\n\nCertain events – such as making a later will, marriage and conversion to Islam – would render a will made prior to them invalid, even if the will was otherwise valid. It would therefore be advisable to take note of such events. In addition, intentional destruction of a will by the testator or a duly executed declaration of revocation by the testator will revoke the will. Unlike a marriage, divorce does not revoke a will.\n\n# 4. Failing to consider the implications of “tenancy in common” and “joint tenancy” when purchasing a property\n\nBoth types of joint ownership – “tenancy in common” and “joint tenancy” – have their pros and cons. A tenant-in-common owner is able to will away to others his/her interest in the property without the consent of the other owners. Should a tenant-in-common die intestate, intestacy laws will apply to his/her share of the property. In Malaysia, jointly held properties tend to be in the “tenancy in common” form. In contrast, a joint-tenancy owner is unable to will away to others his/her interest in the property. Hence, upon his/her demise, the surviving joint tenant or tenants would automatically get his/her interest in the property. Malaysians have to be aware of this type of joint ownership, especially if they jointly hold properties in other countries, where joint tenancy is as widespread as tenancy in common. If a testator subsequently wills away his/her share of a joint tenancy property, it is likely to be disregarded for being void.\n\n# 5. Failing to include back-up nominees\n\nTo be prudent, “what if” possibilities ought to be carefully considered and addressed in your estate planning endeavours. Back-up nominees for executors and trustees should be written into the estate documents in the event one’s original choices pre-decease one or cease to be up to the job in the testator’s opinion.\n\nMalaysian Financial Planning Council (MFPC) / financial 1 st",
